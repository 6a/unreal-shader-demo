Hi! We're MindFluX, and we make art happen!

> This is a texture mapped, game-ready model which can be used in any of your games
> Texture files are included, but the model employs mainly materials (for increased quality)
> You can use this in any of your games or apps (FREE ONLY) but do include us in the credits (as "MindFluX Studios" without the quotes)
> You may edit and this for personal purposes ONLY! But you CAN redistribute this non-commercially
> If you would like to use this commercially, please contact us by dropping a comment on the model page
> Also, if you make an awesome game with any of our assets, drop a comment on the model page (Sketchfab) and mention your game (We'll add your game to a list on our site!)

Thanks, 
The MindFluX Team
